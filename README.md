# E-Commerce Back-end

## Description
In this challenge, the objective was to develop the backend infrastructure for an e-commerce platform, starting with the existing codebase. The primary focus was the integration of Sequelize, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, for seamless interaction with a MySQL database. The initial steps involved configuring an Express.js API, which served as the main conduit for request handling and routing.

Further modifications entailed the creation of models and associations for product categories, products, and tags using Sequelize, ultimately simulating the complex relational structure of a real-world e-commerce database. GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for each model were also established, ensuring a full range of CRUD operations.
